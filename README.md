The task is to develop a neural network capable of recognizing handwritten Arabic characters which are individually provided as character images.

## Dataset

This dataset was prepared and made available by Ahmed El-Sawy, Mohamed Loey, Hazem EL-Bakry, and
their paper "Arabic Handwritten Characters Recognition using Convolutional Neural Network, WSEAS,
2017". The jpg version of the images is available at the following link

**The dataset is composed of 16,800 characters written by 60 participants**, the age range is between 19 to 40
years, and 90% of participants are right-hand. Each participant wrote each character (from ’alef’ to ’yeh’)
ten times on two forms.

**The database is partitioned into two sets:** a training set (13,440 characters to 480
images per class) and a test set (3,360 characters to 120 images per class).
